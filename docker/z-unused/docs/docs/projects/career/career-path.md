## Devs performance review
* for junior devs, ask tech lead + manager types
* for senior devs, since their dev skills are legendary, only evaluate their people skills (via team lead / etc.)

> yeah you either need a tech lead who is also a scrum master
>
> or like you work together \[with team lead\]
>
> like have a inner team inside the team
>
> like the product owner is the captain
>
> you are the lieutenants
>
> the developers are the privates
>
> or you are the sergeants rather

* "managers don't explicitly tell someone that they are a tech lead" --> signs managers don't know how tech team works
